### overview
ï¼´his is for web-based UI shown as the image. It can connect to multiple drones by their IP address and show status of each drone, such as positon, image, healthy status etc. User can sent commands (takeoff, mission, swarm, hover, landing) to drone directly from the UI. Moreover, a Google map is inserted to show realtime location and trajectory of the drones.
