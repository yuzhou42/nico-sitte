abstract: In order to develop a nano UAV in a GPS-denied environment, a visual-inertial system (VINS) consisting of a monocular camera and a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) should be integrated, as they make a minimum, ultra lightweight sensor suite that enables both autonomous flight and sufficient environment awareness. Although there are numerous potential applications, getting to understand the structure of the flight platform can be cumbersome and confusing. Packages and resources provided on the Qualcomm developer network (QCN) and their official GitHub group ATLFlight contain un-unified and disorderly chunks of information. In this paper, we present an organized documentation that presents in detail, the platform structure as a whole, from hardware to software architecture, including installation and API related applications.
