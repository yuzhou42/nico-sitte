I'm currently an associate scientist in the [Intelligent Unmanned System Group](http://www.temasek-labs.nus.edu.sg/program/program_intelligentunmannedsystem.php), [Temasek Laboratories](http://www.temasek-labs.nus.edu.sg/index.php). 
Previously, I was working as a research engineer in the [Biorobotics Lab](http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/biorob/index.html), [National University of Singapore](http://nus.edu.sg/) under [Dr. Haoyong Yu](http://www.bioeng.nus.edu.sg/people/PI/YUHaoyong/)â€™s supervision. 
I was also a member of the [State Key Laboratory of Robotics](http://english.sia.cas.cn/rh/rp/201408/t20140814_125856.html) which is part of the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/).

I am an incoming PhD candidate in the ECE department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests lie in 3D visual perception and navigation, applied machine learning.
